"""Bash control-operator splitting, shared by the hooks that tokenize Bash text.

SINGLE SOURCE. `shlex.split(cmd, posix=False)` forces whitespace_split=True, so an
unquoted run of non-whitespace is ONE token whatever punctuation it carries: a control
operator written with no space in front of it stays glued to the token before it.

    shlex.split('foo > src/log.txt; bar', posix=False)
    -> ['foo', '>', 'src/log.txt;', 'bar']

Every consumer of those tokens then reads a corrupted value (`src/log.txt;`), and the
operator never becomes a token, so the command AFTER it is judged as a trailing argument
of the command before it and never reaches command position. Measured: a credential write
spelled `echo x > .env; ls` was ALLOWED, because `.env;` is not a credential BASENAME,
while `echo x > .env ; ls` was denied.

Both hooks that tokenize Bash text share this: hooks/scripts/writ-bash-write-gate.sh
(write targets, credential classification, egress destinations) and
hooks/scripts/writ-worktree-safety.sh (`git worktree add` detection). Each MIRRORS the
marker-delimited block below verbatim as an inline fallback, because the hooks run under
the system python3 and reach this package only through `sys.path.insert(0, WRIT_DIR)`; a
failed import must degrade to the same behavior, never silently back to the defect.
tests/test_bash_control_operator_split.py asserts the copies are textually identical AND
that they compute identical token streams, so the mirror cannot drift.

This module imports nothing on purpose: it has to load under `python -S` and it has to be
safe to paste inline.

# MIRROR BEGIN split_control_operators
# The marker name is historical: this block is now every bash-token helper the two Bash
# gates SHARE, not the splitter alone. The markers keep their spelling because they are
# the anchor tests/test_bash_control_operator_split.py slices on.

# Tokens that occupy VERB POSITION without being the verb. A group opener, or a reserved
# word that a COMMAND LIST follows, is stepped over exactly the way the WRAPPERS prefixes
# are, because what follows is a real command that really writes: `if true; then cp a
# src/x.py; fi` runs cp, and `(cp a src/x.py)` runs cp.
#
# Each member, and why it is here:
#   ( {                  group openers; a command list follows directly.
#   then do else         reserved words a command list follows directly.
#   if elif while until  a CONDITION follows, which is itself a command list:
#                        `if cp seed.txt .env; then :; fi` really runs cp.
#   !                    pipeline negation; `! cp a b` runs cp.
#
# DELIBERATELY ABSENT, each for a reason:
#   [ [[ test            these ARE the verb, and the write gate suppresses redirects for
#                        a segment whose verb is one of them (seg_is_test). Stepping over
#                        `[[` would make `"$x"` the verb, un-suppress the span, and read
#                        `if [[ "$x" > "config.txt" ]]` as a write to config.txt.
#   (( $((               ARITHMETIC, not a group. The write gate's own `((`/`))` depth
#                        counter owns that spelling; see strip_group_opener.
#   for select case in   what follows is a VARIABLE NAME or a WORD, not a command, so
#                        stepping resolves a WRONG verb instead of recovering a hidden
#                        one. A loop BODY is still covered, because `do` is here.
#   fi done esac } )     closers; nothing follows them inside their segment. A BARE `)`
#                        gets its own treatment; see GROUP_CLOSER_TOKENS.
#   coproc function      both take an optional NAME before the command, the same reason
#                        timeout / stdbuf / nice / setsid / xargs / watch are not
#                        WRAPPERS.

#
# All three MEASURED silent through this hook's extractor before the fix, which is why the
# two substitution spellings are one case rather than a subshell fix plus a guess:
#   $(cp seed.txt src/y.py)   -> set()
#   `cp seed.txt src/y.py`    -> set()
#   (cp seed.txt src/y.py)    -> set()
# The backtick is the older command-substitution syntax and runs the write exactly as
# `$(...)` does, so leaving it out would be a one-character bypass of this fix.
#
# `{` is NOT here, and the reason is EXECUTED rather than read: `bash -c '{echo hi; }'` is
# a SYNTAX ERROR (`syntax error near unexpected token `}'`) while `bash -c '{ echo hi; }'`
# prints hi. A glued `{` does not merely fail to open a group, it does not parse at all,
# so the spelling cannot be a bypass vector and stripping it would only invent a verb for
# a command bash refuses to run. The bare `{` is in GROUP_VERB_TOKENS instead.

# A group closer that sits ALONE on its own token is SYNTAX, not an argument, and it has
# to be dropped where segments are built rather than normalized where values are
# classified. Two reasons, one measured and one structural:
#
#   * MEASURED, before this cycle: `( echo x | tee src/y.py )` already emitted the
#     phantom row ('local', '/proj/)') beside the real one, because the tee arm collects
#     every argument that is not a flag and not a redirect, and a bare `)` is neither.
#     A fully spaced subshell puts the closer on its own token, so `( cp seed.txt
#     src/y.py )` would resolve `cand[-1]` -- the copy DESTINATION -- to `)`, losing the
#     real target as well as inventing a phantom one, which trades this cycle's blind
#     spot for a worse defect.
#   * STRUCTURAL: strip_unbalanced_close cannot help, because the bare token IS the
#     closer and stripping it would yield "", a NONFILE member, which would DELETE rows
#     rather than correct them. So the token never becomes an argument in the first
#     place.
#
# `]`, `]]` and `))` are deliberately NOT here: the write gate COUNTS those tokens to
# suppress redirects inside a comparison or arithmetic span, so dropping them would
# un-suppress the span. `}` is not here either: bash requires a `;` or `&` before it, the
# splitter already makes that boundary, and a lone `}` therefore never shares a segment
# with a write.

    substitution syntaxes close differently:

      * `)` comes off only while the token holds MORE `)` than `(`, which is what a group
        closer looks like from inside the token that ended the group. A filename carrying a

    Two measured defects motivate it, in OPPOSITE directions: `(echo x > <secret>)` was a
    silent allow because `<secret>)` is not a credential basename, and
    `(echo x > /dev/null)` emitted ('outside', '/dev/null)') because `/dev/null)` misses
    the NONFILE exact-string set, so ordinary work was being gated.

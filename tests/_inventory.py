"""Repo populations, derived from their single source.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Four count pins broke during the Maat program, each costing a full suite
run to find, and the cause was DUPLICATION rather than the pins themselves: the hook
registration count was asserted in 4 test files and the hook event count in 7. Adding one
doctor check meant editing a count, a second count, a name set, and a test whose NAME said
"seventeen". Four edits for one change, three of them copies.

So each population gets ONE canonical assertion, kept where the test's declared job is to
review that number (`test_phase51_doc_counts.py` calls itself a "source-derived count
regression gate"), and every other site derives from here and asserts agreement. Growth then
touches production plus at most one test line.

THE TRIPWIRES ARE NOT REMOVED. This module exists to delete copies, not checks. A silent
population change must still fail the suite, and `test_count_pin_discipline.py` asserts that
the canonical tripwire still pins the real number.

THE RISK, and it is the reason every derivation here is asserted non-empty by
`test_count_pin_discipline.py`: a derivation that silently returned nothing would make every
dependent assertion pass on any tree, which is worse than the duplicated literals it
replaced. A vacuous test is a lie that reads like coverage.
